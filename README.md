# Sudoku

A Sudoku application. 

It comes with a GUI that lets you enter your own puzzle or select from a list 
of presets and includes a solver that can be invoked interactively (via a 
"Solve" button in the GUI) or programmatically (using the ``Sudoku`` class).

See docstrings in ``sudoku.py`` for details on what you can do with it.
